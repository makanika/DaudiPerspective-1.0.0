# Cloudflare Deployment Fix

## Issue
The deployment failed because Cloudflare Pages detected a `wrangler.toml` file with invalid configuration for Pages projects.

## What Was Fixed
✅ Removed `wrangler.toml` file (not needed for static Next.js exports on Cloudflare Pages)
✅ Updated deployment documentation
✅ Configured Next.js for static export with `output: 'export'`

## Next Steps

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub
The wrangler.toml file has been deleted locally, but you need to push this change to GitHub:

\`\`\`bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: remove wrangler.toml for Cloudflare Pages deployment"
git push origin main
\`\`\`

### 2. Redeploy on Cloudflare Pages
After pushing, Cloudflare Pages will automatically trigger a new deployment. If it doesn't:

1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Click "View build" or "Retry deployment"

### 3. Verify Build Settings
Make sure your Cloudflare Pages project has these settings:

**Framework preset:** Next.js

**Build command:**
\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

**Build output directory:**
\`\`\`
out
\`\`\`

**Environment variables:** (if needed)
- `NODE_VERSION` = `20.11.0`

## Why This Happened
- `wrangler.toml` is for Cloudflare Workers, not Cloudflare Pages
- Static Next.js sites with `output: 'export'` don't need wrangler configuration
- Cloudflare Pages can deploy directly from the build output

## Verification
Once deployed successfully, you should see:
- ✅ Build completes without wrangler.toml errors
- ✅ Site is accessible at your Cloudflare Pages URL
- ✅ All pages and assets load correctly

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment still fails:
1. Check that wrangler.toml is not in your GitHub repository
2. Verify the build output directory is set to `out`
3. Ensure `next.config.mjs` has `output: 'export'`
4. Check build logs for any other errors

### If you need dynamic features later:
For server-side rendering or API routes, you would need:
- Remove `output: 'export'` from next.config.mjs
- Use Cloudflare Pages Functions instead of wrangler.toml
- Adapt code to work with Edge Runtime
